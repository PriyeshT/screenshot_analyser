This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add your Mistral API key:
   ```
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
   ```
   You can get an API key by signing up at [Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/)

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

- Upload screenshots via drag-and-drop, paste, or file selection
- Extract text from screenshots using Mistral AI's vision capabilities
- Chat with AI about the extracted content
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

## How It Works

1. Upload a screenshot using the upload interface
2. The app sends the image to Mistral AI's API for text extraction
3. The extracted text is displayed and can be used for further analysis
4. You can chat with the AI about the content of the screenshot

If no Mistral API key is provided, the app will fall back to using mock data.
